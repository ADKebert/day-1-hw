        Web design has had an interesting progression.  As a primary use of the internet is to display content to users, it is no surprise that that progression centers around delivering that content in visually pleasing ways.  Aside from being able to display text at all, one of the first problems is to be able to format text into a more meaningful presentation than a single block of words.  HTML provides a good starting point for web design with a relatively simple set of options that can be easily interpreted by multiple browsers while providing basic formatting options.  This certainly improves readability, but humans long to personalize their creations and web pages are no exception.  Colors, fonts, images and animations soon followed and allowed greater expression of individuality.

        This represents a turning point in design where there are far fewer limits on what is possible with a web page.  As anyone who used the internet in the 90s can recall: many aspiring designers were too focused on what they could do to think about what they should do.  It is easy to obscure the content with careless use of the new features.  CSS steps in and makes it easy to develop a consistent style across multiple pages.  Design philosophies change to emphasize the idea that <q>content is king</q>.  These days I think a page is considered elegant if it presents content with great readability and minimal distractions.  It has returned to a form similar to the original HTML only style, and yet the powerful but subtle personalizations deliver a far more flexible and visually appealing product.  In writing brevity and clarity are hallmarks of a good wordsmith and I think web design will strive for similar efficiency. This is because it keeps the focus on the content and keeps the designs more flexible across platforms and displays.
